### Project Documentation: Distributed IoT Sensor Data Management System

---

#### **1. Overview**

This project implements a distributed system designed for managing sensor data collected from various IoT (Internet of Things) devices. The system architecture is depicted in the provided diagram and includes several key components:

1. **Sensors:** Various IoT sensors deployed in the field, responsible for gathering environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and fluid levels.
2. **IoT Gateway:** A local gateway that aggregates data from sensors using UDP and MQTT protocols and forwards this data to the central server using HTTP POST over TCP.
3. **Central Server:** A cloud-based service that receives sensor data from the IoT Gateway. It processes the data and stores it in a distributed database using RPC (Remote Procedure Call) mechanisms.
4. **Distributed Database:** The backend storage that maintains the sensor data, accessible via RPC calls from the central server.

---

#### **2. System Architecture**

The system can be broken down into the following core components as illustrated in the diagram:

1. **Sensors:**
   - **Communication Protocols:** Sensors use UDP to send data to the IoT Gateway.
   - **Data Handling:** Sensors periodically send data (pulled by the IoT Gateway) related to environmental variables like temperature, humidity, and fluid levels.

2. **IoT Gateway:**
   - **Protocol Conversion:** The gateway receives data from the sensors using UDP and MQTT protocols. It then translates this data into HTTP POST requests.
   - **Data Forwarding:** The gateway sends the data to the central server over a TCP connection using HTTP POST requests.
   - **Integration:** The gateway is a bridge between local sensors and the central server in the cloud.

3. **Central Server:**
   - **Data Reception:** The server listens for incoming HTTP POST requests containing sensor data from the IoT Gateway.
   - **Thrift Service:** The server utilizes Apache Thrift to define and execute RPC calls for creating, reading, updating, and deleting entries in the distributed database.
   - **Data Processing:** Upon receiving sensor data, the server creates entries in the distributed database using the `ThriftService`.

4. **Distributed Database:**
   - **Data Storage:** The distributed database is designed to store and replicate sensor data across multiple nodes for high availability and reliability.
   - **RPC Interface:** The database interacts with the central server through Thrift-based RPC calls to manage sensor data.

#### **3. Detailed Component Breakdown**

##### **3.1 Sensor Data Handling (SensorData Class)**

The `SensorData` class is a Thrift-generated class that represents the data structure for sensor readings. Each instance of `SensorData` includes fields for the sensor type, temperature, humidity, and fluid values. The class supports serialization and deserialization through Thrift protocols, allowing efficient transmission of data between the server and the database.

Key Methods:
- **`equals()`, `hashCode()`**: For comparing and hashing `SensorData` objects.
- **`read()`, `write()`**: For serializing and deserializing `SensorData` objects using Thrift protocols.
- **`validate()`**: Ensures that all required fields are set before data is processed.

##### **3.2 TCP Server (TcpServer Class)**

The `TcpServer` class is responsible for handling incoming TCP connections from the IoT Gateway. It processes both GET and POST HTTP requests:
- **GET Requests:** Returns a summary of all sensor data received so far, formatted as an HTML page.
- **POST Requests:** Processes incoming sensor data, confirms receipt to the IoT Gateway, and sends the data to the central server's Thrift client for storage.

Key Methods:
- **`MultiThreaded_TCP` Callable:** Handles incoming requests in a multithreaded manner, enabling concurrent processing of multiple requests.
- **`printData()`**: Responds to GET requests by sending the current state of all sensor data to the client.

##### **3.3 Thrift Service (ThriftService Class)**

The `ThriftService` class defines the RPC interface for interacting with the distributed database. It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting sensor data entries.

Interfaces:
- **`Iface`:** Synchronous interface for the Thrift service.
- **`AsyncIface`:** Asynchronous interface for handling requests without blocking.

Key RPC Methods:
- **`createEntry()`**: Adds new sensor data to the database.
- **`readEntry()`**: Retrieves sensor data by ID.
- **`updateEntry()`**: Modifies existing sensor data.
- **`deleteEntry()`**: Removes sensor data from the database.

#### **4. Communication Protocols**

- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Used by sensors and the IoT Gateway for lightweight, fast data transmission with minimal overhead.
- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** A lightweight messaging protocol for the IoT devices, enabling reliable communication.
- **HTTP/TCP:** The IoT Gateway uses HTTP over TCP to ensure reliable transmission of data to the central server.
- **RPC (Remote Procedure Call):** The central server uses Thrift-based RPC calls to communicate with the distributed database, enabling efficient and secure data management.

#### **5. Deployment Considerations**

- **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to scale horizontally by adding more sensor nodes, IoT Gateways, and distributed database instances.
- **Reliability:** The use of a distributed database ensures data redundancy and high availability.
- **Security:** Secure communication channels (e.g., HTTPS, secure RPC) should be implemented for data transmission, especially when scaling to production environments.

---

#### **6. Future Enhancements**

- **Real-time Data Processing:** Implementing real-time analytics on the central server to process and act on sensor data as it arrives.
- **Enhanced Security:** Integrating encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure data across all layers of the architecture.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Adding failover mechanisms in the IoT Gateway and central server to handle network or hardware failures.

### **Conclusion**

This system is a robust and scalable solution for managing sensor data in a distributed IoT environment. By leveraging modern communication protocols and distributed database technologies, it provides a foundation for efficient data collection, processing, and storage, with the flexibility to grow and adapt to future needs.
